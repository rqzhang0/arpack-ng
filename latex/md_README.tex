\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{About the project}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
This project started as a joint project between Debian, Octave and Scilab in order to provide a common and maintained version of arpack. This is now a community project maintained by a few volunteers. Indeed, no single release has been published by Rice university for the last few years and since many software (Octave, Scilab, R, Matlab...) forked it and implemented their own modifications, arpack-\/ng aims to tackle this by providing a common repository, maintained versions with a testsuite. {\ttfamily arpack-\/ng} is replacing arpack almost everywhere.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Important Features}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Reverse Communication Interface (RCI).
\item Single and Double Precision Real Arithmetic Versions for Symmetric, Non-\/symmetric, Standard or Generalized Problems.
\item Single and Double Precision Complex Arithmetic Versions for Standard or Generalized Problems.
\item Routines for Banded Matrices -\/ Standard or Generalized Problems.
\item Routines for The Singular Value Decomposition.
\item Example driver routines that may be used as templates to implement numerous
\item Shift-\/\+Invert strategies for all problem types, data types and precision.
\item {\ttfamily arpackmm}\+: utility to test arpack with matrix market files. Note\+: to run this utility, you need the eigen library (to handle RCI).

About ILP64 support\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Sequential arpack supports \href{https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/onemkl-linux-developer-guide/top/linking-your-application-with-onemkl/linking-in-detail/linking-with-interface-libraries/using-the-ilp64-interface-vs-lp64-interface.html}{\texttt{ ILP64}}, but, parallel arpack doesn\textquotesingle{}t.
\item Reminder\+: you can NOT mix {\ttfamily ILP64} with {\ttfamily LP64}. If you compile {\ttfamily arpack-\/ng} with {\ttfamily ILP64} (resp. {\ttfamily LP64}) support, you MUST insure your BLAS/\+LAPACK is compliant with {\ttfamily ILP64} (resp. {\ttfamily LP64}).
\item Set {\ttfamily INTERFACE64} at configure time.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note for F77/\+F90 developers\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All files which needs {\ttfamily ILP64} support must include {\ttfamily \char`\"{}arpackicb.\+h\char`\"{}}.
\item When coding, use {\ttfamily i\+\_\+int} (defined in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{arpackicb_8h_source}{arpackicb.\+h}}}) instead of {\ttfamily c\+\_\+int}. {\ttfamily i\+\_\+int} stands for ISO\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+BINDING integer\+: it\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily \#defined} to {\ttfamily c\+\_\+int} or {\ttfamily c\+\_\+int64\+\_\+t} according to the architecture.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note for C/\+C++ developers\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All files which needs {\ttfamily ILP64} support must include {\ttfamily \char`\"{}arpackdef.\+h\char`\"{}}.
\item When coding, use {\ttfamily a\+\_\+int} (defined in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{arpackdef_8h_source}{arpackdef.\+h}}}) instead of {\ttfamily int}. Here, {\ttfamily a\+\_\+int} stands for \char`\"{}architecture int\char`\"{}\+: it\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily \#defined} to {\ttfamily int} or {\ttfamily int64\+\_\+t} according to the architecture.

\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{ISO\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+BINDING support}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
About ISO\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+BINDING support\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The install will now provide {\ttfamily arpack.\+h/hpp}, {\ttfamily parpack.\+h/hpp} and friends.
\item Examples of use can be found in {\ttfamily ./\+TESTS} and{\ttfamily ./\+PARPACK/\+TESTS/\+MPI}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

ISO\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+BINDING is a feature of modern Fortran meant to handle safely interoperability between Fortran and C (in practice, no more need to use ugly tricks to link F77 functions to C code using \char`\"{}underscored\char`\"{} symbols). Basically, ISO\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+BINDING make sure all fortran variables are typed (which may not always be the case when using {\ttfamily implicit} keyword in fortran)\+: this way, C compilers can link properly. For more informations on ISO\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+BINDING, you can checkout the following links\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/ISO_C_BINDING}{\texttt{ http\+://fortranwiki.\+org/fortran/show/\+ISO\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+BINDING}}
\item \href{http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Generating+C+Interfaces}{\texttt{ http\+://fortranwiki.\+org/fortran/show/\+Generating+\+C+\+Interfaces}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Using ICB is seamless\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Compile {\ttfamily arpack-\/ng} with ISO\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+BINDING\+: you\textquotesingle{}ll get both old-\/fashion fortran symbols and new ISO\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+BINDING symbols available for linking.
\item Add {\ttfamily \#include \char`\"{}arpack.\+h\char`\"{}} in your C code.
\item Replace all \mbox{[}sdcz\mbox{]}\mbox{[}ae\mbox{]}upd calls by \mbox{[}sdcz\mbox{]}\mbox{[}ae\mbox{]}upd\+\_\+c\+: functions suffixed with \+\_\+c are ISO\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+BINDING compliant (exposing same arguments than original fortran functions).

\item Where can I find ARPACK user\textquotesingle{}s guide?

\href{http://li.mit.edu/Archive/Activities/Archive/CourseWork/Ju_Li/MITCourses/18.335/Doc/ARPACK/Lehoucq97.pdf}{\texttt{ http\+://li.\+mit.\+edu/\+Archive/\+Activities/\+Archive/\+Course\+Work/\+Ju\+\_\+\+Li/\+MITCourses/18.\+335/\+Doc/\+ARPACK/\+Lehoucq97.\+pdf}}
\item Calling arpack\textquotesingle{}s aupd methods returns {\ttfamily info = -\/9 -\/ Starting vector is zero.}\+: why?

Residuals are null. Try to set {\ttfamily resid} to small values (like epsilon machine magnitude) but {\itshape not exactly} zero. Residuals {\ttfamily resid = A$\ast$v -\/ lamdba$\ast$v} target {\itshape exactly} the zero vector. When {\ttfamily resid} is close enough to zero, the iterative procedure stops.
\item Say I have an estimate of an eigen value, how to give this information to arpack?

You need to shift of an amount of about this estimate of {\ttfamily lambda}. Grep {\ttfamily back\+Transform} in {\ttfamily arpack\+Solver.\+hpp} to see an example. For more informations, checkout \char`\"{}\+NUMERICAL METHODS FOR LARGE EIGENVALUE PROBLEMS\char`\"{} by Yousef Saad\+: \href{https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~saad/eig_book_2ndEd.pdf}{\texttt{ https\+://www-\/users.\+cse.\+umn.\+edu/$\sim$saad/eig\+\_\+book\+\_\+2nd\+Ed.\+pdf}} (paragraph 4.\+1.\+2. and section 4.\+1.).
\item Say I have an estimate of an eigen vector, how to give this information to arpack?

You need to copy this eigen vector estimate in {\ttfamily v} (not {\ttfamily resid}) and set {\ttfamily info} to 1 before calling aupd methods. The {\ttfamily v} vector targets a non-\/null vector such that {\ttfamily resid = 0}, that is, such that {\ttfamily A$\ast$v = lambda$\ast$v}.
